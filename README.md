# ameliaCustomTestFileMaker

This repo is being setup to refactor an app I wrote to make regression testing Amelia easier and more time efficient.

This tool allows you to upload as many Amelia regression test files as you want, then select the specific tests you want to run. You will be given a customized CSV file with the tests you selected.
